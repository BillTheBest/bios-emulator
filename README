************
* Overview

This is a minimal BIOS stub for the Intel Single-chip Cloud Computer (SCC),
intended to ease porting startup code of operating system kernels (especially
the Linux kernel). It currently implements a minimal set of BIOS interrupts that
should be sufficient to allow booting an SCC-capable Linux kernel without
changes to the real-mode startup code.

The BIOS emulator supports single-core operation only -- i.e., it does not
provide a Single System Image view, but runs an isolated instance on each core.
Furthermore, it is supposed to be used with the regular sccKit tools like sccGui
or sccBoot. It does not support self-boot and does not contain bootstrap code,
just passive implementations of BIOS interrupts.


*****************
* Configuration

* Private Memory Size:SCCBIOS_QUERY_MEMSIZE_FROM_FPGA,SCCBIOS_DEFAULT_MEMSIZE_MB
  The PRIVATE MEMORY SIZE is reported via the E820 memory map. By default, this
  size is read from the FPGA's GRB space, which is accessible under the default
  LUT configuration at 0xF9008244 ("Private memory slots").
  By commenting out the line #define-ning SCCBIOS_QUERY_MEMSIZE_FROM_FPGA, a
  default of SCCBIOS_DEFAULT_MEMSIZE_MB (in Megabytes) is used.


Upon starting, configuration information can be displayed on a serial terminal
connected to COM1 (I/O port 0x3f8). This is controlled via the following macros
(which be disabled/enabled by commenting/uncommenting the appropriate lines in
the source file):

(Disabled by default)
* SCCBIOS_TRACE_INT15_CALLS
  Output a message for each invocation of INT15.

(Enabled by default)
* SCCBIOS_PRINT_BANNER
  Display banner message.

* SCCBIOS_PRINT_FREQUENCY_FROM_FPGA
  Read and display tile frequency. This requires the FASTCLOCK register
  (0xF9008230) to be set correctly.

* SCCBIOS_PRINT_TILEID
  Display TILEID value.

* SCCBIOS_PRINT_MEMSIZE
  Display configured size of private memory.

Serial output has been tested with both the UART simulation in sccGui (stock
crbif) and a modified crbif that included the UART automatons. Please note that,
if no UART emulation is active on the MCPC, sccGui will display a warning about
an unexpected NCIOWR packet for each character written to the non-existent COM
port.
